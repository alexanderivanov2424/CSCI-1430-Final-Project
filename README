Directory Structure:

RawImages - Folder with images used as input
ResultImages - Folder with resulting images from Deep Content Transfer

Run Code:

DeepTransfer.py performs most of the heavy lifting.
To select custom source and target images modify the lines:
18 | source = get_image_as_array("./RawImages/Coral.jpg")
19 | target = get_image_as_array("./RawImages/Tree.jpg")

To adjust the step size and the number of iterations modify the line
81 | new_img = run_deep_transfer(source, target, steps=50, step_size=0.01)

For more in-depth experimentation the layers used for the style model can be
adjusted. Refer to the layers names printed in the tf.summary() and add the
desired layer names to the style_names list. Note the list cannot be empty.

Implementation Notes:

Early versions used a separate set of layers to perform a "deep dream" as well
as the style transfer. For this reason there is also the option to select
"dream layers". The loss that corresponds to these layers is not incorporated
and can be turned on by adding the dream_loss() to the output of loss() in
model.py

LocalizedTransfer.py was made for some testing purposes and is kept for archival
purposes. Some modifications of model.py may be necesary to achieve full results.
